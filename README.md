# Silo UI

An interface for Silo.

This project is divided into two blocks, the contract part ([Silo Contratcs](https://github.com/theocdl/silo-contracts)) and the UI part.



## Run

In the `react-app` folder, replace the `.env.example` with a `.env` file. You can get your Web3 Storage token here: [https://web3.storage](https://web3.storage) and your Infura project ID [there](https://infura.io/).

```shell
yarn && yarn react-app:start
```

## Use

Click on the `Company` button to get registered (you must put an IPFS link with a json file for your company information). âœ¨

After this, you can create contracts for the sale of your wheat crops in the `Company` section as you have previously registered. ðŸŒ½
In this section you can also change the selling price of your contracts and modify your company information.
